# **Amazon-Like Storefront**

## Overview
The app will take in sell items to customers by taking orders, updating inventory and tracking total sales. The user also can check the product sales across the departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Getting Started
*	First, the user must have either “Terminal” for Mac or “Git Bash” for PC, and node.js. In addition, the installation of the color package would provide the color-coded messages.

## Description
*	For the customer's view, the user simply types “node bamazonCustomer.js” to view the sale items and to make a purchase. Type an item ID and the quantity to purchase the item. If there is sufficient inventory, the messages will show the total sale, update the remaining quantity, and complete the purchase. 
*   For the manager's view, the user types "node bamazonManager.js" to get a menu selection of (1) view products for sale, (2) view low inventory, (3) add to inventory, (4) add a new product, (5) delete a poduct, and (6) exit manager view. The messages will show and help the user to view the sale items, add or delete the products, understand whether there is any insufficient quantity, and update the quantity. 
*   For the supervisor's view, the user can view the overhead, product sales and total profit in each department in a table view.
